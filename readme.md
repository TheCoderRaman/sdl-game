An SDL Game! v0.1
==============
Building a simple cross platform game and engine with SDL
--------------

Primarily 2D, hopefully to make something cool with in the end.

Code is built using cmake, a cross platform make tool.

It's organised into the main game source, and Libraries.

Current libraries are

- LEngine (Link Engine), Link because Link is a cool guy who don't take no sh*t
- SDLInterface, Interface with SDL
- Util, General purpose, possibly too generic and ready for refactoring

Development
--------------

	dev branch is used for general development
	master branch for major releases
	use feature branches all the time. It really helps
